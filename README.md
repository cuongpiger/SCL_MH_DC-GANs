# 1.Description
* This project using DC-GANs architecture to build model can generate fake images that people can hard to know those images are fake.
* Using TensorFlow to create model, these pictures below are fake images about furniture, cars and animals that the model was generating during 200 epoch.
  * Epoch 10.<br>
